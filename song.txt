YOU AND I (GAROU)
Well I'm starting the day trying to find different ways to get through
Till it's time to come back And I can't slow it down and I'm climbing the walls and I feel like I'm under attack
There's too many people that get in my way
And there's never a right time that I get to say
When you and I touch hands when you and I stop
Still in the moment it's you and I
Not running for something that's already gone
When it's just you and I that's when I'm home
That's when I'm home
There's always the question what's holding me down
Show me an answer cause I haven't found
Show me an answer cause I haven't found
A way to escape to get out of it all
Somewhere that I am allowed to fall
With no bones to break I can be who I am
Cause you know me better than anyone
When you and I touch hands when you and I stop
Still in the moment it's you and I
Not running for something that's already gone
When it's just you and I that's when I'm home That's when I'm home
Home's not a house with windows and walls not a place to be shut in
There are no doors
And no matter where I come to rest your arms will be my safety net
