Well I'm starting the day trying to find different ways to get through
Till it's time to come back And I can't slow it down and I'm climbing the walls and I feel like I'm under attack
There's too many people that get in my way
And there's never a right time that I get to say
When you and I touch hands when you and I stop
Still in the moment it's you and I
Not running for something that's already gone
When it's just you and I that's when I'm home
That's when I'm home
There's always the question what's holding me down
Show me an answer cause I haven't found
